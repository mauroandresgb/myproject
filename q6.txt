#The change inside increment_int_a does not change the variable a after the function call because integers in Python are immutable, and the function operates on a local copy of the integer.

#The change inside increment_int_b does change the variable b after lthe function call because dictionaries in Python are mutable, and the function modifies the original dictionary object.
